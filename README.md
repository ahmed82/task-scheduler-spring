Spring Task Scheduler
TaskScheuler was introduced in Spring 3.0 with a variety of methods to run at some point in the future,
it also returns a representation object of ScheduledFuture interface, which could be used to cancel scheduled task or check if it's done or not.
## @ThreadPoolTaskScheduler
ThreadPoolTaskScheduler is well suited for internal thread management, as it delegates tasks to the ScheduledExecutorService and implements the TaskExecutor interface â€“ so that single instance of it is able to handle asynchronous potential executions as well as the @Scheduled annotation.

## Solve many thread running

        size: 10

Scheduled tasks don't run in parallel by default. So even if we used fixedRate, the next task won't be invoked until the previous one is done.
If we want to support parallel behavior in scheduled tasks, we need to add the @Async annotation
